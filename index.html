    <div class="dllink">
        <p>The following web application does two things:

            It gathers video titles and thumbnails from the ABC News channel and displays the first 25 videos. When clicked the videos will direct you to the youtube link. 
            The second API can take a text file of valid longititude and latitude coordinates and mark them on the google map.
            
            The website also provides a link to a python application which can scrape posts off of reddit and twitter. 
            The python app requires the praw and twikit packages which can be installed with pip. You must also have a reddit developer account as well as a twitter account to
            use this app. The credentials can be entered by modifying the appropriate variables in the python script.</p>

The following web application does two things:

It gathers video titles and thumbnails from the ABC News channel and displays the first 25 videos. When clicked the videos will direct you to the youtube link. 
The second API can take a text file of valid longititude and latitude coordinates and mark them on the google map.

The website also provides a link to a python application which can scrape posts off of reddit and twitter. 
The python app requires the praw and tweepy packages which can be installed with pip.
